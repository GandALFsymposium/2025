Welcome to the website of **GandALF 2025**, the 
*Sixteenth International Symposium on Games, Automata, Logics, and Formal Verification*, 
that will take place in Valletta, Malta, on 16-17 September 2025. 
The conference will be hosted by [University of Malta](https://www.um.edu.mt/) at its [Valletta Campus](https://www.um.edu.mt/campuses/valletta/) and it is organized by the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.um.edu.mt/ict/cs/).

The aim of GandALF 2025 is to bring together researchers from academia and industry 
who are actively working in the fields of Games, Automata, Logics, and Formal Verification. 
The idea is to cover an ample spectrum of themes, from theory to applications, 
and stimulate cross-fertilization. 
Papers focused on formal methods are especially welcome. Authors are invited to submit 
original research or tool papers on all relevant topics in these areas. 
Papers discussing new ideas that are at an early stage of development are also welcome. 
The topics covered by the conference include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Automata Theory
- Automated Deduction
- Computational aspects of Game Theory
- Concurrency and Distributed computation
- Decision Procedures
- Deductive, Compositional, and Abstraction Techniques for Verification
- Finite Model Theory
- First-order and Higher-order Logics
- Formal Languages
- Formal Methods for Systems Biology, Hybrid, Embedded, and Mobile Systems
- Games and Automata for Verification
- Game Semantics
- Logical aspects of Computational Complexity
- Logics of Programs
- Modal and Temporal Logics
- Model Checking
- Models of Reactive and Real-Time Systems
- Probabilistic Models (Markov Decision processes)
- Program Analysis and Software Verification
- Reinforcement Learning
- Run-time Verification and Testing
- Specification and Verification of Finite and Infinite-state Systems
- Synthesis
